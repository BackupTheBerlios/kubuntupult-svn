0.2 to 0.3
	-- Katapult --
	Feature: Katapult now has its own icon, thanks to Lee Olson!
		<clearbeast at gmail dot com>
	Feature: You can now see multiple results by pressing down (configurable)
	Feature: You can now select an action first and then select items which
		match that action (for example, matching only programs by selecting
		run program). Press Tab before typing anything to access this feature.
	Feature: It is now possible to choose a different action than
		the default, either by pressing Tab before typing anything, or (if you
		have disable autoexecution) by pressing Tab after finding a result.
	Feature: It is now possible to refresh the catalogs (this should be done
		automatically after I add multithreading)
	Bugfix: Katapult no longer crashes if you try to execute a query with no
		results
	Technical: Katapult now used KShared for items, so that it is now much
		easier to prevent a catalog from deleting an item in use when its
		results are cleared (this should prevent a lot of potential crash bugs)
	
	-- Glass Display --
	Feature: new look and the ability to draw panes of arbitrary size (required
		for the multi-item views).
		
	-- Document Catalog --
	Bugfix: sometimes selecting a directory would open a child directory instead
	Bugfix: sometimes results were deleted before they were unneeded (crash)

0.1 to 0.2
	-- Katapult --
	Feature: when there are no results, the query can be cleared or the
		display hidden (configurable) (as requested)
	Feature: word abbreviations can now be used (if you type the beginning
		of a word and press space, it will try to guess the word.
	Feature: if you type the beginning of a word besides the first word
		of an item, the query will start there (as requested)
	Feature: added the ability to backspace
	Improvement: the settings dialog no longer hides catalog pages when
		you click on the main catalog configuration page
	Optimize: actions are now handled more efficiently, and can easily be
		reused
	Bugfix: fixed a bug that caused the program to sometimes lock while
		automatically executing an action
	Bugfix: some duplicate items were not removed, which prevented
		automatic execution
	
	-- Program Catalog --
	Feature: added the ability to ignore programs without icons
	Feature: programs can be cataloged by executable name instead of
		the name from the .desktop file
	Bugfix: I think I nailed the crash-on-execute-program bug
	
	-- Bookmark Catalog --
	Feature: added the ability to include bookmarks from Mozilla

	-- Document Catalog --
	Feature: Katapult can now catalog your documents (in your home folder)

	-- Glass Display --
	Bufix: fixed a bug where the item text would sometimes leak into the
		action text
	Feature: fonts now dynamically resize to optimally fit text (configurable)
