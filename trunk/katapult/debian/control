Description: item launcher for KDE
 Katapult is an application, which analyses text-based queries
 to launch items, such as bookmarks, directories or programs.
 .
 The application is currently in an early stage of development but 
 the launchable item list can be extended by a plugin system, and
 the look and feel can be skinned.
