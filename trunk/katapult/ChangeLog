        * plugins/display/puredisplay: added a new display. Note: this is partly a very ugly hack, but it works :). 
                Mostly for testing of new displays with 2 different sizes.

0.1 to 0.2
	-- Katapult --
	Feature: when there are no results, the query can be cleared or the
		display hidden (configurable) (as requested)
	Feature: word abbreviations can now be used (if you type the beginning
		of a word and press space, it will try to guess the word.
	Feature: if you type the beginning of a word besides the first word
		of an item, the query will start there (as requested)
	Feature: added the ability to backspace
	Improvement: the settings dialog no longer hides catalog pages when
		you click on the main catalog configuration page
	Optimize: actions are now handled more efficiently, and can easily be
		reused

		automatically executing an action
	Bugfix: some duplicate items were not removed, which prevented
